Ocean Waves Audio Placeholder

This file represents where the ocean waves audio file should be placed.

For the Focus Mode feature to work properly, you'll need to add:
- ocean-waves.mp3 (MP3 format)
- ocean-waves.ogg (OGG format for better browser compatibility)

The audio should be:
- Gentle, soft ocean wave sounds
- Loopable
- Approximately 2-3 minutes long
- Low volume to not distract from reading

You can find free ocean wave sounds at:
- freesound.org
- zapsplat.com
- pixabay.com

Place the audio files directly in this directory (public/audio/) and the Focus Mode will automatically use them.
